> [!IMPORTANT]
> This script works **only on Linux**.

Python scripts that display Ninjabrain Bot info using notifications or pinned image overlays (Linux).  This is mainly useful for **single-monitor** users, but also helpful for those with a second monitor.

## Display Methods
I created two ways to display Ninjabrain Bot info. The first uses desktop notifications, while the second shows the built-in overlay provided by Ninjabrain Bot as a pinned image. You can also customize the pinned image overlay. Choose whichever method you prefer.
- To use desktop notifications, download `NBTrackr-Notif-v2.1.6.tar.xz`.
- To use the pinned image overlay, download `NBTrackr-imgpin-v2.1.6.tar.xz`.

> You can scroll down to the [Features](https://github.com/qMaxXen/NBTrackr?tab=readme-ov-file#features-desktop-notifications) section to see what each method looks like.

## Installation

> [!CAUTION]
> The **desktop notifications method** requires the **dunst notification daemon** to display notifications correctly. It automatically checks if dunst is installed, and if not, installs it, then disables your current notification daemon and starts dunst.

1. Enable API in Ninjabrain Bot.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're using the **pinned image overlay method**, you must also enable the **OBS Overlay** option in Ninjabrain Bot settings.  
> This is required for the overlay image to appear on your screen.

2. Go to the [releases](https://github.com/qMaxXen/NBTrackr/releases/tag/v2.1.6) section of this repository and download your preferred version.
- For desktop notifications, download `NBTrackr-Notif-v2.1.6.tar.xz`
- For pinned image overlay, download `NBTrackr-imgpin-v2.1.6.tar.xz`
3. Move the downloaded file to a convenient folder, then extract it using the terminal with the following command:
```bash
tar -xf <filename>
```
4. You have to install the required Python packages to run NBTrackr with the following command:
```bash
cd <extracted-folder>
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
> [!TIP]
> Getting the `PEP 668 (externally-managed-environment)` error after running `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`? Create a Python virtual environment:
> ```bash
> # Make sure you are in the extracted folder
> python3 -m venv venv
> source venv/bin/activate
> pip install -r requirements.txt
> ```
> To run the script from the terminal without needing to enter the venv, use the Python binary inside the venv:
> ```bash
> /full/path/to/venv/bin/python <script>.py
> ```

5. Now run the script with the following command:

For desktop notifications:
```bash
python3 NBTrackr-Notif.py
```
For pinned image overlay:
```bash
python3 NBTrackr-imgpin.py
```

## Features: Desktop Notifications

- The notification appears on top of your Minecraft window.
- Shows whether you have a red or green boat:

## Features: Pinned Image Overlay

### Basic Pinned Image Overlay Features

- The pinned image overlay will not appear if Ninjabrain Bot has no calculations.
- The pinned image overlay appears on top of your Minecraft window.
- Shows whether you have a red or green boat:
  - The red or green boat pinned image is shown for only 10 seconds.
  - If you have blue boat, no pinned image will be shown.
- You can freely move the overlay.
- The pinned image position gets saved and restored.
  - Position data is saved in `~/.config/NBTrackr/settings.json`

> [!TIP]
> I recommend using the [custom pinned image overlay](https://github.com/qMaxXen/NBTrackr?tab=readme-ov-file#customization-custom-pinned-image-overlay), as the default one uses Ninjabrain Botâ€™s `nb-overlay.png`, which updates with a delay. The custom pinned image overlay uses the API directly, so it updates instantly with no delay.

### Customization: Custom pinned image overlay

- Run the `Customizer-imgpin.py` script to choose your overlay preferences.
  - Customization settings are saved to `~/.config/NBTrackr/customizations.json`.
- To display the overlay in-game, run the `NBTrackr-imgpin.py` script.

> The GUI for `Customizer-imgpin.py` is heavily inspired by the [Jingle-CalcOverlay-Plugin](https://github.com/Marin774/Jingle-CalcOverlay-Plugin) by **Marin774**.

### Known bugs

- **NBTrackr-imgpin on Wayland:** Hovering over the pinned image overlay while Minecraft is the active window may freeze the screen.
  - To unfreeze, switch to another workspace.
  - Because of this, if you want to move the pinned image overlay, do so while Minecraft is not the focused window.
